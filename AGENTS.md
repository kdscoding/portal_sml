# Laravel Application

This repository contains a Laravel application. Complete the following setup before working on the user's request.

## Prerequisites

Verify that PHP and Composer are available:

```sh
php -v
composer -V
```

If either command is unavailable, detect the user's operating system and install the prerequisites with the appropriate command:

macOS:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/mac/8.5)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://php.new/install/windows/8.5'))
```

Linux:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.5)"
```

After installation, ask the user to restart their terminal. If the agent needs the restarted shell to continue, ask the user to reopen their terminal and rerun their original prompt.

## Agent Setup

Install Laravel Boost from the application root before making application changes:

```sh
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

Boost replaces these bootstrap instructions with guidelines tailored to the application. After installation, read `AGENTS.md` again and continue with the user's original request using the generated guidelines.

## vexp - Context-Aware AI Coding <!-- vexp v3.1.3 -->

### Context strategy: call run_pipeline ONCE at task start
If the task already names the files/symbols to touch, SKIP vexp. Otherwise one
`run_pipeline({ "task": "..." })` returns ranked pivot files with line ranges and
blast radius. Do NOT open files one by one to find your way around - every extra
tool call costs a turn. Call it again ONLY when the task moves to a new area.
`get_skeleton` for files to understand, not edit. `verify_done` before calling a
multi-file task complete, then RUN the tests it names.

### Query shape (do this)
Anchor the task on real identifiers (ClassName, functionName) or file paths:
`run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT expiry in AuthService.validateToken" })`

vexp runs entirely on this machine, index in `.vexp/`;
`run_pipeline` transmits nothing to any external service.
On `status: "degraded"` or 0 pivots the index is still building - use your own tools.
For literal string sweeps use your native search - do NOT route text sweeps through vexp.
Repo SOURCE only: logs, dist/, node_modules/ and files outside the repo are NOT indexed.
